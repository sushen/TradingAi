The idea is I am making a database I am sharing you the script.

The script name is make_database :

"""
Script Name: make_database_ex.py
Author: Sushen Biswas
Date: 2023-03-26
"""
In the database script I make all the necessary table for the data I get from exchange.
The historical data and other table that help me to predict cripto currency price and trand.

then I start grabbing data and store in the database and resample it. The reason I resample it
because you know if I make a api call from the exchange for moving average data which is 200 moving
average golden line data 200 candle closing candle in needed . I have to make API call in various
kind of API call in the exchange so I don't want to do that. The idea is I am just collecting 1 minute
data and then in the local database I resample it for any kind of indicator calculation.


The script name is grab_data :
"""
Script Name: grab_data.py
Author: Sushen Biswas
Date: 2023-03-26
"""

I already shared with you. then what I do I get 1 minute data from then I just resample the
data to 3minutes, 5minutes, 15minutes, 30minutes, 1hours, 4hours, 1week data from that timeframe
data and the form that 1minutes, 3minutes, 5minutes, 15minutes, 30minutes, 1hours, 4hours, 1week data
I make all the candlestick pattern and necessary indicator.

and to do that use script Store store data:
"""
Script Name: store_in_db.py
Author: Sushen Biswas
Date: 2023-03-26
"""

Store_in_bd storing data in the database.


after that I use tow script for resample
1st Script is :
"""
Script Name: create_resample_data.py
Author: Sushen Biswas
Date: 2023-03-26
"""

2nd Script is:
"""
Script Name: resample.py
Author: Sushen Biswas
Date: 2023-03-26
"""

So I will share your all the things and share you the script and I want you to tell me
what and  where I am mistake actually and the full workflow is not work properly I am
stacking. I want your help to tell me where actually I need to focus.

I use 5 Script to all the job.
1. make_database_ex.py
2. grab_data.py
3. store_in_db.py
4. create_resample_data.py
5. resample.py

I am share you the full code one by one if you need.
